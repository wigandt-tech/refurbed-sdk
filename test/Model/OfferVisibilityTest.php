/**
 * OfferVisibilityTest Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category    Class
 * @description Indicates if and how an offer is shown on the refurbed platform.   - FULL: Offer is normally shown to customers.  - NONE: Offer is not shown to customers (e.g. does not ship into this market, is out of stock, is not verified,...).  - LIMITED: Offer was hidden from some pages by refurbed (e.g. because price is higher than refurbed&#39;s instance SRP).  - HIDDEN: Offer was hidden by refurbed (e.g. because of an unreasonably low or high price).
